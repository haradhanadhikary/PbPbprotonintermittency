# Pb+Pb at 13A, 30A publication: Proton intermittency 

## Recent status:

1. Results are preliminary released (presented in many conferences)

## Next step for publications:

1. Final release of proton intermittency results of Pb+Pb at 13A and 30A ---> target to final release by mid February 
2. Draft of the publication ---> expecting to ready first version by end of February  
3. First Editorial board meeting of this this publication ---> probably first week of March

## Work remaining for final release:
1. Cross-checking preliminary release results using latest production of Pb+Pb data (cross-checking almost done)
2. Checking results with acceptance map (N.B: preliminary results were done with Ar+Sc 13A, 30A MC "Pb+Pb EPOS MC data wasn't available that time")

## MC comparison and exclusion-plots (maybe not part of final release but needed for publication):
1. Started MC comparison for Pb+Pb at 13A and 30A: now EPOS MC data (~100k events) are available now
     - working on to define "number of forward spectator" for 0-10% centrality MC event (Uzair worked on it at the same time I am checking also)
     - "Acceptance map" using Pb+Pb at 13A, 30A MC ---> then I will use it for MC comparison also needed for exclusion plots
     - MC comparison (pure EPOS (smeared), rec EPOS, .. )
       
2. exclusion plots (work for Tobiasz after final release)

## Drafting publication
- Started to draft the paper for Pb+Pb, text are taken from Ar+Sc 13-75A proton intermittency paper
