# Pb+Pb at 13A, 30A publication: Proton intermittency 

## Status of results:

1. Results are preliminary released (presented in many conferences)

## Next step for publications:

1. Final release of proton intermittency results of Pb+Pb at 13A and 30A

   (mid February)
2. Draft of the publication

   (end of February)  
3. First Editorial board meeting for this publication

   (first week of March)

## Work remaining for final release (full presentation on next week in Kielce Analysis meeting):
1. Cross-checking preliminary release results using latest production of Pb+Pb data

   (cross-checking almost done)
3. Checking results with acceptance map

   (N.B: for preliminary results, acceptance maps were created with Ar+Sc 13A, 30A MC due to lack of EPOS MC data of Pb+Pb MC)

## MC comparison and exclusion-plots: 

(maybe not part of final release but needed for publication)

1. Started MC comparison for Pb+Pb at 13A and 30A:

   (now EPOS MC data (~100k events) are available now)
   
     - working on to define "number of forward spectator" for 0-10% centrality MC event

        (Uzair worked on it at the same time I am checking also)
       
     - "Acceptance map" using Pb+Pb at 13A, 30A MC

       (then I will use it for MC comparison also needed for exclusion plots)
       
     - Smearing using Pb+Pb 13A, 30A MC and experimental data
       
     - MC comparison

       (pure EPOS (smeared), rec EPOS, .. )
       
3. Exclusion plots:

   (more fun for Tobiasz after final release)

## Drafting publication:
- Started to draft the paper for Pb+Pb, text are taken from Ar+Sc 13-75A proton intermittency paper
